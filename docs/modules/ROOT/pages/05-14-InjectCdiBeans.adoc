= Inject CDI Beans into Message Handler Methods

Application scoped beans can be injected in message handler methods. The beans are injected into methods annotated with

* CommandHandler
* QueryHandler and
* EventHandler


Here is a simple example of an injection into a command handler.

[source,java]
----
@CommandHandler
void handle(MyCommand command, MyBean bean) {
    // ...
    bean.doBeanStuff();
    // ...
}
