= Command Bus

== Default Behaviour

The Command Bus is initialized with the default of the Axon Framework.

This also includes the special CommandBus, if the Axon Server is used as EventStore.

== Custom Command Bus

If you would like to provide your own command bus you simply have to provide the CDI Bean CommandBusConfigurer.

This bean is used to configure the CommandBus in the Axon Framework.

An example to provide your own Async CommandBus with virtual threads could look like this:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCommandBusConfigurer implements CommandBusConfigurer {

    @Override
    public CommandBus createCommandBus(Configuration configuration) {
        return AsynchronousCommandBus.builder()
                 .executor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                 .build();
    }

}
----
