= Quarkus Axonframework Extension
include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

This guide explains how to use quarkus together with the axon framework.

== What is Quarkus Axonframework

Axon Framework assists developers in implementing message-driven applications. That means that you can implement applications using Event Sourcing and CQRS.

== Creating an Event Sourcing Application

=== The domain

Gift cards can be issued with an initial amount. +
Those gift cards can then be used for payments. +
Under some circumstances, it is necessary to cancel the last payment.

=== Example architecture
The model handles the commands.

A rest service for requesting the current amount of the card uses a query. The query is handled by an in-memory projection.

The commands are submitted by a test.

=== Getting started (after 0.1.0-RC1)

Add the following import to your build file:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>at.meks.quarkiverse.axonframework-extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-axon</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Compatibility matrix & supported versions
The latest LTS and the current version quarkus are supported. Axon framework is updated as soon as it is released, updated in the extension running without error.

|===
| Extension Version | Quarkus | Axon framework

| 0.1.0-quarkus-3.15-RC1
| 3.15.1
| 4.10.1

| 0.1.0-RC1
| 3.16.2
| 4.10.1

|===


You can now create the commands, events and the model.

==== Events and Commands

[source,java]
----
public class Api {
    public record IssueCardCommand(@TargetAggregateIdentifier String id, int initialAmount) { }
    public record CardIssuedEvent(String id, int amount) { }
    public record RedeemCardCommand(@TargetAggregateIdentifier String id, int amount) { }
    public record CardRedeemedEvent(String id, int amount) { }
    public record UndoLatestRedemptionCommand(@TargetAggregateIdentifier String id, int amount) { }
    public record LatestRedemptionUndoneEvent(String id, int amount) { }
}
----

==== Model

The model contains the domain logic. It contains the handlers

* CommandHandler and
* EventSourcingHandler

As an example for a domain service, the Command UndoLatestRedemptionCommand is handled not by the root aggregate, but by a domain service.

The EventSourcingHandler methods are necessary for tracking the state of the aggregate, which is used for validation.

[source,java]
----
public class Giftcard {

    @AggregateIdentifier
    private String id;
    private int currentAmount;
    private final List<Integer> cardRedemptions = new ArrayList<>();

    Giftcard() { // <1>
        // necesarry for the axon framework
    }

    @CommandHandler
    Giftcard(Api.IssueCardCommand command) { // <2>
        if (command == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("command mustn't be null");
        }
        apply(new Api.CardIssuedEvent(command.id(), command.initialAmount())); // <3>
        Log.infof("new card with the id %s and the initial amount %s was issued", command.id(), command.initialAmount());
    }

    @EventSourcingHandler
    void handle(Api.CardIssuedEvent event) { // <4>
        this.id = event.id();
        this.currentAmount = event.amount();
    }

    @CommandHandler
    void handle(Api.RedeemCardCommand command) { // <2>
        if (this.currentAmount < command.amount()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                    "amount(" + command.amount() + ") must be less than current card amount(" + currentAmount + ")");
        }
        apply(new Api.CardRedeemedEvent(id, command.amount())); // <3>
        Log.infof("card was redeemed by %s", command.amount());
    }

    @EventSourcingHandler
    void handle(Api.CardRedeemedEvent event) { // <4>
        this.currentAmount -= event.amount();
        cardRedemptions.add(event.amount());
    }

    public void undoRedemption(int amount) { // <5>
        Optional<Integer> lastestRedeemedAmount = lastestRedeemedAmount();
        if (lastestRedeemedAmount.isEmpty() || lastestRedeemedAmount.get() != amount) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("amount must be the lastest redeem amount");
        } else {
            apply(new Api.LatestRedemptionUndoneEvent(id, amount));
            Log.infof("latest redemption was undone");
        }
    }

    private Optional<Integer> lastestRedeemedAmount() {
        if (!cardRedemptions.isEmpty()) {
            return Optional.of(cardRedemptions.get(cardRedemptions.size() - 1));
        }
        return Optional.empty();
    }

    @EventSourcingHandler
    void handle(Api.LatestRedemptionUndoneEvent event) { // <4>
        cardRedemptions.remove(cardRedemptions.size() - 1);
        this.currentAmount += event.amount();
    }

    @ExceptionHandler
    public void handleAll(Exception exception) {
        throw new CommandExecutionException("wrapped exception in details", exception);
    }

}
----
<1> An empty constructor is necessary for the axon framework that it is able to load the aggregate from the event store and apply its events
<2> the command handler methods, which handle the requested commands
<3> the event is applied if the validation was successful
<4> the event sourcing handler methods, which are invoked when an aggregate is read from the repository and when a command handling method applies an event
<5> this methode is executed by the domain service


===== Domain service
The domain service gets the repository for the gift card injected. +
It handles the undo command by loading the aggregate from the repository and then invoking a method on the aggregate.

This is useful if one command modifies more aggregates.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class DomainServiceExample {

    @Inject
    Repository<Giftcard> giftcardRepository; // <1>

    @CommandHandler
    void handle(Api.UndoLatestRedemptionCommand command) { // <2>
        Aggregate<Giftcard> giftcardAggregate = giftcardRepository.load(command.id()); // <3>
        giftcardAggregate.execute(giftcard -> giftcard.undoRedemption(command.amount())); // <4>
    }

    @ExceptionHandler
    public void handleAll(Exception exception) {
        throw new CommandExecutionException("wrapped exception in details", exception);
    }

}

----
<1> the axon repository is injected
<2> the handler method for the command
<3> First the aggregate is read, using the injected repository
<4> A method of the aggregate is executed

==== Projection
The current amount is built and queried using a projection.

The project listens to the necessary events using the annotation EventHandler
and updates the amount of each gift card in memory in a simple map.
In production systems, this information should be persisted e.g., in a database.

It also handles the query with a method annotated by QueryHandler.
It gets the amount from the in memory map and returns the id and the amount of the card.

[source, java]
----
public record GiftcardQuery(String id) { }
----

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class GiftcardProjection {

    private final Map<String, GiftcardDto> giftcards = new HashMap<>();

    @QueryHandler
    GiftcardDto handle(GiftcardQuery query) { // <1>
        return giftcards.get(query.id());
    }

    @EventHandler
    void handle(Api.CardIssuedEvent event) { // <2>
        giftcards.put(event.id(), new GiftcardDto(event.id(), event.amount()));
    }

    @EventHandler
    void handle(Api.CardRedeemedEvent event) { // <2>
        giftcards.get(event.id()).redeem(event.amount());
    }

    @EventHandler
    void handle(Api.LatestRedemptionUndoneEvent event) { // <2>
        giftcards.get(event.id()).undoLatestRedemption(event.amount());
    }
}

----
<1> The handler method for the query request, which return the gift card with the requested id
<2> The event handler methods, which are necessary to project the current amounts of each gift card

A rest service gets the QueryGateway injected and queries a card by id, using the GiftcardQuery.

[source,java]
----
@Path("giftcard")
public class GiftcardResource {

    @Inject
    QueryGateway queryGateway;

    @GET
    public Uni<GiftcardDto> getGiftcard(@RestQuery String id) {
        return Uni.createFrom()
                .future(() -> queryGateway.query(new GiftcardQuery(id), GiftcardDto.class));
    }

}
----

==== Test

The test submits the commands using the injected CommandGateway. +
It uses the rest service to verify the expected current amount of the gift card. +
It also verifies that exceptions are thrown if commands are not valid.

[source,java]
----
@QuarkusTest
@TestHTTPEndpoint(GiftcardResource.class)
class ApplicationTest {

    @Inject
    CommandGateway commandGateway; // <1>

    @Test
    void wholeUseCaseTest() {
        var cardId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        commandGateway.sendAndWait(new Api.IssueCardCommand(cardId, 20)); // <2>
        commandGateway.sendAndWait(new Api.RedeemCardCommand(cardId, 2)); // <3>
        commandGateway.sendAndWait(new Api.RedeemCardCommand(cardId, 4)); // <3>
        commandGateway.sendAndWait(new Api.RedeemCardCommand(cardId, 3)); // <3>

        assertThatException().isThrownBy(() -> commandGateway.sendAndWait(new Api.RedeemCardCommand(cardId, 12))) // <4>
                .havingCause()
                .withMessageContaining("must be less than current card amount");

        RestAssured.given().queryParam("id", cardId)
                .when().get()
                .then()
                .body("id", CoreMatchers.equalTo(cardId), "currentAmount", CoreMatchers.equalTo(11));

        commandGateway.sendAndWait(new Api.UndoLatestRedemptionCommand(cardId, 3)); // <5>
        assertThatException().isThrownBy(() -> commandGateway.sendAndWait(new Api.UndoLatestRedemptionCommand(cardId, 2))) // <6>
                .havingCause()
                .withMessageContaining("amount must be the lastest redeem amount");

        RestAssured.given().queryParam("id", cardId)
                .when().get()
                .then()
                .body("id", CoreMatchers.equalTo(cardId), "currentAmount", CoreMatchers.equalTo(14));
    }

}
----
<1> The CommandGateway of the Axon framework is injected, to be able to send commands. This also works in production classes
<2> A new gift card is requested
<3> Some payments are requested. Those payments are valid because the card amount is still greater.
<4> A payment is requested with an amount, greater than the current amount of the gift card -> an error is expected
<5> A cancellation of the last valid payment is requested
<6> A cancallation of the last valid payment with the wrong amount is requested -> an error is expected



=== Event Store

CAUTION: By default, the In-Memory Event Store is used. This normally shouldn't be used in production systems because on shutdown the events are lost.

Currently, you have to options to use another event store. Either use the extension "quarkus-axon-server" or implement your own custom event store by implementing the interface "EventstoreConfigurer".

In future releases at the least the jdbc event store will be added as an extra extension.

==== Axon Server connection

Add the dependency

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>at.meks.quarkiverse.axonframework-extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-axon-server</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

When starting with dev or test profile, the Axon Server is started as dev service. For production use the connection details can be configured using the keys

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.axon.server.context=default
quarkus.axon.server.hostname=localhost
quarkus.axon.server.grpc-port=8124
----

All you have to do is to define the correct host name, port and context if they don't match the default value.

==== Custom Event Store
To provide your custom event store you just have to implement the interface blabla.

Here is an example how it could look like:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCustomEventstoreConfigurer implements EventstoreConfigurer {


    public void configure(Configurer configurer) {
        configurer.configureEventStore(this::myCustomEventstore);
    }

    private EventStore myCustomEventstore(Configuration conf) {
        // here you setup your custom event store
    }
}
----
For more details of how to setup an event store, please read the axon framework documentation.

=== Event Processors

Event Processors are necessary for event handler.
Those processors need to know which events are already processed.
This information is stored in a token store.

CAUTION: By default, the subscribing processor with an in-memory token store is used. This normally shouldn't be used in production systems because on shutdown the token store is lost.

The different processors can be used by adding the dependency the one, you would like to use.

The artifact ids are:

- quarkus-axon-persistent-stream-eventprocessor
- quarkus-axon-pooled-eventprocessor
- quarkus-axon-tracking-eventprocessor

With the exception of the persistent stream, the other processors need a token store where the information is stored, which events were already processed.

For more details on how to add a persistent token store, read the section <<Tokenstore>>.

For details about the different event processors and the token store,
please read the documentation of the Axon framework.

=== Tokenstore
CAUTION: By default, an in-memory token store is used. This normally shouldn't be used in production systems because on shutdown the token store is lost.

Currently only the JDBC Tokenstore is supported.

==== JDBC Tokenstore
If you would like to use the JDBC Tokenstore you simply have to add the dependency to the extension, and setup a datasource in quarkus.

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>at.meks.quarkiverse.axonframework-extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-axon-tokenstore-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

By default the database table is created on startup. If you don't want to create the table automatically, you can disable the creation.

CAUTION: Normally in production environment you need a proper transaction manager configured in the axon framework. For detailed information see <<Transaction>>.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.axon.tokenstore.autocreate-table-for-jdbc-token=false
----

Currently it is not supported to have more than 1 configured datasource.

==== Custom Tokenstore
To provide your custom tokenstore you just need to implement the interface "TokenStoreConfigurer".

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCustomTokenStoreConfigurer implements TokenStoreConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void configureTokenStore(Configurer configurer) {
        configureAndSetupTokenstore(configurer.eventProcessing());
        configurer.registerComponent(TokenStore.class, this::createTokenStore);
    }

    private TokenStore createTokenStore(Configuration configuration) {
        // setup your token store here
    }
}
----

For more information on setting up a token store, please read the axon framework documentation.

=== Transaction
CAUTION: By default, no transaction management is setup.

If you need transaction management you can simple add the extension:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>at.meks.quarkiverse.axonframework-extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-axon-transaction</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

It uses the quarkus transaction management configured into the axon framework.

=== Metrics
If you want to use metrics you can enable it by adding the extension:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>at.meks.quarkiverse.axonframework-extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-axon-metrics</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

Using the configuration, you can disable the metrics:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.axon.metrics.enabled=false
----

Futhermore axon provides the possibility to use tag for the metrics. This is enabled by default but can also be disbabled using the configuration:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.axon.metrics.with-tags=false
----

=== Health Checks

If the quarkus extension for health checks (quarkus-smallrye-health) is added, checks for the Axon Server connection and for the event processors are activated.

Axon Server connection health checks are only active if you have added the extension quarkus-axon-server to your project.

If you would like to deactivate the health checks, you can do that by setting the properties(just one or both)

- quarkus.axon.health-enabled
- quarkus.axon.server.health-enabled

to false. Be aware that these settings are build-time settings. That means that these settings are considered at build time only. You can't overrule this setting at runtime e.g., using an environment variable.

=== Access to Axon objects

If you need to access the

- EventBus
- EventGateway
- CommandBus
- CommandGateway
- QueryBus
- QueryGateway or
- a aggregate repository

you can simply inject it to your CDI bean. The repository and the command gateway injection is shown in the example above.
