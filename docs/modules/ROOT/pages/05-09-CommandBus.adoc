= Command Bus

== DuplicateCommandHandlerResolver

Axon provides three different behaviors, how the framework handles duplicate commands.
You can configure your preferred behavior in the application.properties file.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.axon.command-bus.duplicate-command-handler-resolver=rejectDuplicates
----

The possible values are

* rejectDuplicates
* logAndOverride
* silentOverride

When the application starts and a duplicate command handler is detected by the axon framework, the configured resolver
will be executed. In the case of `rejectDuplicates` an exception occurs during startup.

This behavior is also considered if you are using the Axon Server.

The default is `rejectDuplicates`, to avoid unexpected behavior.

== Custom Command Bus

If you would like to provide your own command bus you simply have to provide the CDI Bean CommandBusConfigurer.

This bean is used to configure the CommandBus in the Axon Framework.

An example to provide your own Async CommandBus with virtual threads could look like this:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCommandBusConfigurer implements CommandBusConfigurer {

    @Override
    public CommandBus createCommandBus(Configuration configuration) {
        return AsynchronousCommandBus.builder()
                 .executor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                 .build();
    }

}
