= Health Checks

If the quarkus extension for health checks (quarkus-smallrye-health) is added, checks for the Axon Server connection and for the event processors are activated.

Axon Server connection health checks are only active if you have added the extension quarkus-axon-server to your project.

If you would like to deactivate the health checks, you can do that by setting the properties(just one or both)

- quarkus.axon.health-enabled
- quarkus.axon.server.health-enabled

to false. Be aware that these settings are build-time settings. That means that these settings are considered at build time only. You can't overrule this setting at runtime e.g., using an environment variable.
